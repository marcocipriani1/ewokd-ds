## Running Ewokd

Ewokd uses a **Procfile** to manage multiple processes, allowing you to run both the web server and the bot worker concurrently.

> You will need to create a `task.csv` file in the root folder of the server and populate it yourself according to the example provided in `task_example.csv`.

Then run:

```bash
honcho start
```

- Honcho will start both processes and prefix logs (`web | ...`, `worker | ...`) for clarity.

- You can stop both processes at any time with `Ctrl+C`.

### Running Ewokd as a Systemd Service

Ewokd comes with a `systemd` unit file, so you can run it as a service that starts on boot and restarts automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** The included systemd unit file points to `/root/ewokd-ds` by default. Modify the paths in the unit file to match your installation directory.

#### Instructions

1. Copy the included systemd unit file to the system directory:

```bash
cp ewokd.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

2. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

3. Start Ewokd:

```bash
systemctl start ewokd.service
```

4. Enable it to start automatically on boot:

```bash
systemctl start ewokd.service
```

5. Check the status or view live logs:

```bash
systemctl status ewokd.service
journalctl -u ewokd.service -f
```

## Development Notes

- The code is actively being revised ‚Äî expect breaking changes.
- You are encouraged to create your own scripts or extensions.
- Future official extensions will not prevent you from maintaining custom scripts.
