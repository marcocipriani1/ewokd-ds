# Ewokd-Discord

**Ewokd** is a bot that tracks tasks, notifies you when they‚Äôre available, estimates your EWOQ earnings, and calculates the time spent working based on each task's RPH (rate per hour). 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in progress** ‚Äî The code is actively being developed. The install script does not work yet, the extension is not published, and the code should be reviewed carefully. You are free to create your own scripts and extensions.

> üì± A Telegram version is coming soon.

## Running Ewokd

Ewokd uses a **Procfile** to manage multiple processes, allowing you to run both the web server and the bot worker concurrently.

> You will need to create a `task.csv` file in the root folder of the server and populate it yourself according to the example provided in `task_example.csv`.

Then run:

```bash
honcho start
```
- Honcho will start both processes and prefix logs (`web | ...`, `worker | ...`) for clarity.

- You can stop both processes at any time with `Ctrl+C`.

### Running Ewokd as a Systemd Service

Ewokd comes with a `systemd` unit file, so you can run it as a service that starts on boot and restarts automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** The included systemd unit file points to `/root/Ewokd-Discord` by default. Modify the paths in the unit file to match your installation directory.


#### Instructions

1. Copy the included systemd unit file to the system directory:

```bash
cp ewokd.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

2. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```
3. Start Ewokd:

```bash
systemctl start ewokd.service
```

4. Enable it to start automatically on boot:

```bash
systemctl start ewokd.service
```

5. Check the status or view live logs:

```bash
systemctl status ewokd.service
journalctl -u ewokd.service -f
```

## Development Notes

- The code is actively being revised ‚Äî expect breaking changes.
- You are encouraged to create your own scripts or extensions.
- Future official extensions will not prevent you from maintaining custom scripts.
