            **üìñ Instructions for using Ewok**

            Please follow the steps below to use Ewok and the extension:

            1. üÜî **Take Note of Your User ID**
               - Make sure to take note of your user ID. You will need it to log in to Ewok and insert it in the Ewok settings page.

            2. üíª **Download Ewok Chrome extension**
               - Extract the files from the compressed archive into a convenient folder.
               - Use an unzip utility, such as 7-Zip on Windows or The Unarchiver on macOS, or right-click and select 'Extract All'.
               - Delete the .zip file after extracting the files.
               - Remember to keep the extension folder. Removing it will cause the extension to stop working after the next browser restart, and you'll need to reinstall it.

            3. üõ†Ô∏è **Install Ewok Chrome extension**
               - Open your browser and go to the 'Extensions' page.
               - Enable 'Developer mode' in the top right corner.
               - Click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder containing the extracted Ewok files.
               - The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

            4. üí° **Download Ewok Extension**
               - Download Ewok Extension
               - Follow the same extraction and installation steps as before to set up the Ewok extension.

            5. üö™ **Log in to Ewok**
               - Enter your user ID to log in to Ewok.
               - Open the Ewoq home page in your browser.
               - Keep the Ewoq home page open so that the bot can check for notifications and send them to your Discord.

            6. ‚öôÔ∏è **Configure Ewok Extension**
               - Open the Ewok extension settings page.
               - Enter your user ID in the settings to enable automatic reporting to the bot.

            7. üìù **Track Tasks and Generate Reports**
               - Work on your tasks as usual.
               - When you're finished, open the Ewok extension.
               - Click the 'Send Report to Bot' button to receive Welocalize-recognized time for your work.

            Enjoy using Ewok! üòäüöÄ
